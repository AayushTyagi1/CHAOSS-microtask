# CHAOSS-microtask
for GSOC #286 for the idea "Packaging and Sharing CHAOSS metrics using GrimoireLab dashboards"

## GrimoireLab 
GrimoireLab is a Python toolset for software development analytics. It allows you to retrieve data from many kinds of systems with information related to software development, and produce analysis and visualizations with it. It allows you to retrieve data from many kinds of systems with information related to software development, and produce analysis and visualizations with it.
With the tools in the GrimoireLab toolset you can retrieve data, store it in databases, analyze it, and produce nice dashboards for interactively visualizing the resulting information.

It provides components for:
-Automatic and incremental data retrieval from software development support systems (data sources).
-Automatic organization and enrichment of retrieved data.
-Management of different identities for the same person, and other data related to persons, such as affiliation to companies.
-Visualization of the data in actionable dashboards.
-Production of reports about specific aspects of software development processes.

## Idea #286
In the current stage, GrimoireLab doesn't provide an approach to share custom dashboards, thus limiting the end-user capabilities. This project idea is about implementing such an approach leveraging on Python, the Kibana API, ElasticSearch and OpenDistro for ElasticSearch (ODFE).
